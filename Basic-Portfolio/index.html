	<h2>About Me</h2>

	<img class="aboutImg" src="assets/images/et-600x450.jpg">

	<p class="aboutP">I popped out of my mother on May 3rd,1995 born in<br /><br /> New Jersey raised here as well. I wasn't a big fan of<br /><br /> school growing up but I loved learning so whenever<br /><br /> something has my attention it's 100% concentration.<br /><br /> Finally getting into coding was about three months<br /><br /> prior when in the middle of the summer my friend<br /><br /> was talking to me about how he was taking an off year from school and mentioned <br /><br /> bootcamps. I had no idea what coding was when he first mentioned it only that I've<br /><br /> played around with html and I didn't even realize it was code until later on. After<br /><br /> doing my research it seemed to grab my attention enough to try it out, finishing a<br /><br /> couple online courses had taken my interest to the next level wanting to have a<br /><br /> cirriculum structured around my education of code. That is how I ended up at<br /><br /> Rutgers Coding Bootcamp today. As far as outside of code I bike 3 miles a day to<br /><br /> and from work to keep me active, I'll play any sport with a friend. Reading and Art<br /><br /> seems to entertaint me more now a days then television/games/movies, to keep up<br /><br /> to date with these current events in art/tech I use Medium, Thenextweb, and<br /><br /> Hypebeast.  </p>
